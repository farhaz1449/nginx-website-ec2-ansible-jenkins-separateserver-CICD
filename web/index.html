<h2>A Miracle of Science - James Webb Space Telescope</h2>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed primarily to conduct 
infrared astronomy. As the largest optical telescope in space, its greatly improved infrared 
resolution and sensitivity allow it to view objects too early, distant, or faint for the 
Hubble Space Telescope. This is expected to enable a broad range of investigations across the 
fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation 
of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable 
exoplanets. Deployed by AFZ</p>
